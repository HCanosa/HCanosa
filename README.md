## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» Systems Development Student at FATEC AntÃ´nio Russo
I began my journey in the tech industry after recognizing a great opportunity, which led me to mentorship experiences with Volkswagen. Iâ€™m driven by the potential of software development, a field with high demand and excellent career prospects.

Currently, Iâ€™m studying Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC AntÃ´nio Russo, after completing my technical education at ETEC Jorge Street. In parallel with my studies, I have been working for over three years at a self-employed business in digital marketing, developing strategies to help brands thrive in the online environment.

Iâ€™m always open to learning and collaborating with like-minded individuals to bring together technology, innovation, and business for impactful results.
